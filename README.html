2.About
House of Curiosity is a web application that empowers community members to share their knowledge by hosting their own seminar. User could view all the seminars posted by other users. Similarly, a user could also host a seminar and share his/her interesting ideas and knowledge. This is meant as a free sharing platform for ideas, so users could post any kind of seminars' schedule on the website! If they are a huge civil war buff, they can post a seminar title "How The Western Theatre of the War was fought" and with its scheduled time and the access code(either a ZOOM meeting code or real life events). A customizable page will be generated with a countdown to show all the information about the seminar and some information about the author too. Similarly, that seminar could also be seen in other user's front page as a thumbnail.
